# Eeveelution-Assets
# Description
Here you'll find some Godot assets for your Eeveelution fan games!
Most of the art comes from the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series. I did not make the art contained within these files, merely distilled it into a Godot usable format for Pokémon fans to use and expand the Pokémon universe.

# How to use
Take any one of the folders inside Eeveelution-Assets, then drag and drop the folder inside your Godot project (the same folder with the "project.godot" file, it won't work otherwise). Afterwards, open up the project in Godot and it'll automatically import all the assets!
